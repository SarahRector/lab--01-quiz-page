        <h2>A Brief History of Roller Derby</h2>
        <div class = text id = 'history'>
            <span>Roller derby has origins in the banked-track roller-skating marathons of the 1930's.
                 Professional roller derby quickly became popular and in 1940, more than 5 million
                  spectators watched in about 50 American cities.  Modern roller derby is an 
                  international sport, mostly played by amateurs.  Most teams are all-female teams, 
                  but there is a growing number of male, unisex and junior roller derby teams.  
                  It was under consideration as a roller sport for the 2020 Summer Olympics but....well, 
                  COVID pretty much ruined that. The league here in Portland is the Rose City Rollers 
                  and our international travel team, The Wheels of Justice, is currently ranked number 
                  one in the world!</span>

        <h2>How to Play!</h2>
        <div class = text id = 'gameplay'>
            <span>Roller derby is played in two periods of 30 minutes. Two teams of up to 15 players 
                each field up to five members for episodes called "jams". Jams last two minutes unless 
                called off prematurely. Each team designates a scoring player (the "jammer"); the other 
                four members are "blockers". One blocker can be designated as a "pivot"â€”a blocker who 
                is allowed to become a jammer in the course of play. The next jam may involve different 
                players of the 15 roster players, and different selections for jammer and pivot.

                During each jam, players skate counterclockwise on a circuit track. Points are scored 
                only by a team's jammer. After breaking through the pack and skating one lap to begin 
                another "trip" through the pack, the jammer scores one point for passing any opposing 
                blocker. The rules describe an "earned" pass; notably, the jammer must be in-bounds 
                and upright. The jammer's first earned pass scores a point for passing that blocker 
                and a point for each opponent blocker not on the track (for instance, serving a 
                penalty, or when the opposition did not field five players for the jam). 
                
                Each team's blockers use body contact, changing positions, and other tactics to help 
                their jammer score while hindering the opposing team's jammer.</span>

                <h1>Who's on the track for each team?</h1>

                <li>4 Blockers</li>

        <h2>GnarWall's Favorite Players</h2>
        <div class = text id = 'players'>
            <span>Wow! There are so many amazing players to choose from. For me, what makes a really 
                amazing derby player is someone who not only has skills on the track, but also has 
                personality, excellent teamwork and someone who seems like they genuinley aren't a 
                jerk. A good derby name doesn't hurt either!

                <h1>My Top Three as of This Moment</h1>
                <br>
                <li>Smarty Pants: Plays for Texas and is just a smart, nice person.  She's also one 
                    one of the few players who can be a blocker, jammer and pivot and be really great
                    at all three roles!
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Braun Swanson: Hello. That name is really all you need. Braun used to play here in 
                    Portland, but moved with their sibling (who also plays roller derby....Scald Eagle) 
                    back to Denver where they now play. Braun always bouts wearing a Ron Swanson inspired 
                    moustache. It's beautiful.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Erin Jackson: Erin Jackson plays for Jacksonville and is one of the fastest jammers 
                    you will ever see in your life. In her roller derby off season, Erin actually trains 
                    for the olympic speed skating team. She is also, like nearly everyone in derby, not a 
                    jerk in real life.
